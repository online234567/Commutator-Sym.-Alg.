# Commutator-Sym.-Alg.
The commutator of certain symmetry algebra.
Program was tested in Pycharm ver.18.1.4.

Goal:
The goal is to calculate $TS^d(M_n(A))^ab.$ See more description about this in the paper ``Determinants, characters, deformation rings and character varieties''
Different Coefficient:

Coefficient ``lenth''$=d=3$(default), ``rank''$=n=3$(default).
When $d=2$ and $n=2$ the results coincide with the calculation results by hand.

Computation Complexity:
The $d=n=2$ is easy (for computer).
When $d=n=3,$ 10 seconds might cost.
