# Commutator-Sym.-Alg.
The commutator of certain symmetry algebra.
Depress ''PeacefulReasonableGzip.rar'' and run main.py.
Program was tested in Pycharm ver.18.1.4.

Goal:
The goal is to calculate the commuatator ideal of $TS^d(M_n(A)).$ 
See more description about this in Example 4.3 of ''Determinants, characters, deformation rings and character varieties''

Different Coefficients:
Coefficient ''lenth''$=d=3$(default), ''rank''$=n=3$(default).
When $d=2$ and $n=2$ the results coincide with the calculation results by hand.

Computation Complexity:
The $d=n=2$ is easy (for computer).
When $d=n=3,$ 10 seconds might cost.
